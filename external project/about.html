        <h2>How We Started</h2>
        <p>At a young age, Kate has always wanted to dance because it was seen as an expression of how someone was feeling. Whether happy, sad, or mad, Kate saw the movement of the body as a wonderful way of letting out how someone feels. She wondered "Why can't I do that? Dance is seen as diverse so why is it limited to people like me?" With the help of Abigail, the two created this organization to further the diversity and openness of dance to all, able bodied or not.</p>

                <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>Our goal from the very beginning was to expand the idea of diversity in terms of who can dance. Breaking walls and creating new standards! We want everyone to be able to express themselves in any way they want and dance is no exception!
